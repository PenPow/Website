I feel like I should put a small disclaimer before this article

*please do not learn to code through discord bots - its not a good idea*, if you want to learn discord bot development, I highly recommend the [discord.js guide](https://discordjs.guide/#before-you-begin) as it is a great resource.

And so with that out the way, lets now talk about how I decided to learn programming, through discord bots.

# My Starter Project

My journey began 5 years ago. Without a drop of knowledge about how code works, I chose to write a discord bot, involving a lot of technical details I had no clue how to implement, in Javascript, a language known for being... interesting

> https://github.com/denysdovhan/wtfjs : which dedicates itself to showcasing the quirks of javascript

> http://www.jsfuck.com/ : write any javascript code with just six characters

As I said, interesting language choice, but I was determined to make a bot, so I sat down and opened up Youtube, big mistake \#1

## Tutorial Hell

Youtube at the time was great for tutorials about Discord bot development. I made my first bot in around two weeks, and it felt great, and so I made another bot, once again following the same tutorial, and once again, it worked and I felt great.

The issue first arised when I wanted to expand upon my bot to use some of the new discord features released at the time, and this was where I first had an issue, I had no clue how to. I was in tutorial hell.

While I understood what my code was doing, I had no clue how to build upon it or fix any issues I had with it. My code was inevitably full of bugs and errors, but these were all foreign concepts to me, as when following a tutorial, you are guided step by step through writing code that has no issues.

## Escaping Tutorial Hell

Escaping Tutorial Hell was difficult, but it was one of the best decisions I made.

The first thing I did was delete every project I had worked on so far - looking back I probably should have just moved them to a USB but hindsight is an amazing thing, and create a new one.

I closed youtube and spent *a while* writing a bot from scratch, using only the official discord.js documentation and guide. It took a while, but doing so taught me what my code was doing and really helped me to understand how to fix the issues I encountered during software development.

# My Transition to Typescript

It was a few years later when I got introduced to TypeScript. And while I won't dive to much into the benefits of TS here, as it deserves its own article, but learning how to fully take advantage of it was great.

# Looking Back

Looking back at my code and my experiences with learning, I think I could have learnt a lot better, but I also think that learning to program through Discord was an amazing thing, as its tied in so many different technologies that I now use outside of Discord programming.

I wouldn't advise making a discord bot as a beginner project, but I would recommend it to other programmers, as its

- Fun
- Interactive
- Challenging
