import Heading from '@components/Heading.astro';

<Heading title="Text Formatting" size="h3" />

Normal text obviously works, however specific formatting works as well.

Text can be **bold** or _italic_ (or a combination of ***both***).

[Hyperlinks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) work as expected[^1]

> That link leads to a special website by the way

Let that last point be ~~struck from the record~~

> Another aside to state that emojis are made accessible with proper screenreader tags: ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€
